        On the following screen you will see {{ n }} hypothetical scenarios.
        In each scenario you can choose between a payment that you would receive today and a payment that you
        would receive in a year from now.
        The payment today will be the same in each scenario ({{ c }}{{ p }}).

        The payment in 12 months increases from scenario to scenario.
        Its value is {{ c }}{{ p1 }} in the first scenario, {{ c }}{{ p2 }} in the second, {{ c }}{{ p3 }} in the third,
        and so on. In the last scenario, the value is {{ c }}{{ mp }}.

    {% if enforce_consistency %}
    <p>
        Since the payment in 12 months gets better and better in each scenario,
        you should switch from the payment today to the payment in 12 months only once.
        This means that, if in a certain scenario you choose the payment in 12 months,
        then you should choose the payment in 12 months also in the subsequent scenarios.
        Likewise, it means that you should choose the payment today in all the preceding scenarios.
        In other words, the scenario in which you accept the payment in 12 months will mark
        the point where you stop to choose the payment today and you begin to choose the payment in 12 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        To simplify your task, you will only have to select the point in which you switch your selection
        from the payment today to the payment in 12 months. To do this, you only need to click on the payment in 12 months
        in the scenario in which you want to switch, and click on the payment today in the scenario before that.
        Mind that you can revise your decision for as long as you want before submitting it.
        That is, you can change the switching point until you are satisfied.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please, indicate the scenario where you choose the payment in 12 months over the payment today.

            After you have submitted your decision, one of the {{ n }} scenarios will be randomly chosen for
            your payment.
            If, at the randomly chosen scenario, you chose the lottery option, your payoff will be determined according
            to the corresponding probabilities. Otherwise, you will earn the safe payment.
